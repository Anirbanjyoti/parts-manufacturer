          An executive summary is the overview of your entire business plan and
          should succinctly highlight the most important parts of the plan. Your
          executive summary is more than just a general outline of your business
          plan, though; your business plan’s audience is often busy executives
          and investors, so the executive summary might be the only part they
          read. For this reason, you want it to adequately convey all the
          document’s contents in an engaging and concise way.
